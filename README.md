ICREATIVE CO — OSINT Dashboard (I-RECON)

Welcome to I-RECON, an OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) dashboard developed by ICREATIVE CO. This platform curates a set of browser-based scripts ("bookmarklets") for security researchers, privacy analysts, and ethical hackers to extract and interact with publicly available data across major social networks.

All scripts run locally in your browser, don't require credentials, and are designed for responsible, ethical use.

    Editable Scripts: Modify tool code and download .js files for customized workflows.
    No Credentials Needed: Does not require login or authenticate on third-party sites.
    Live Search: Quickly find tools by keyword (e.g. "BandLab", "FB", "JSON").
    Responsive Layout: Grid-based, adaptable dashboard layout.
    Quick Links: Fast access to documentation, updates, settings, and support.

🛠️ Code Management Advice

To maintain and scale your project, consider the following practices:

    Modularize Scripts: Store each bookmarklet tool in its own file/module for easier updates.
    Documentation: Document each tool’s function and API endpoints in a docs/ folder.
    Version Control: Tag releases when adding/removing tools or major UI changes.
    Testing: Validate every script for changes in third-party site layouts/APIs.
    Security: Make sure utility functions (like copy/download) don't introduce XSS or other vulnerabilities.
    Community Contributions: Consider accepting issues & PRs for new tools or improvements.
    Demo/Preview: Host a demo page (GitHub Pages) with non-sensitive showcase videos or screenshots.
